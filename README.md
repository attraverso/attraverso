### Hi there 👋

I'm a WebDev student from Italy, trying my hand at becoming a Fullstack Developer.

<h2>🌱 Currently learning:</h2>

Frontend-wise, I've mainly worked with jQuery so I've been trying to integrate the curriculum by studying JS plain on the side.<br>
On the backend side of things, Laravel is the go-to framework.

<h2>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:</h2>

Dream goal? One (1) particular RoR project. We'll see. :grin:

More generally, anything I can get my hands on :heart:

<h2>📫 How to reach me:</h2>
